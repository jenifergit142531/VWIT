Agenda :

- Export
- Services
- Dependency Injection
- Create a mock project using angular

Angular Services :

- piece of code / logic that performs specific task
- reusability of code across multiple components
- services needs to be injected into the application using dependency injection

Two ways,

- Inject on Provider
- Constructor injection

?  vs ! 

? - guard against null or undefined values
- safe navigation operator
- guard declaration
- if the value is available use it or do nothing

! - not null or undefined 
- not-null assertisn operator
- trust declaration
- i promise that i will initialize the values at later point in the code
