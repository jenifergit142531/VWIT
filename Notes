Agenda :

- Introduction to angular
- Environment setup
- Basic commands (build,run,serve,version)
- Understand the folder structure
- Create a new angular application
- Components
- template vs templateurl
- style vs styleurl
- Modules
- Data Binding 

Angular :

- front end framework
- to develop web and mobile applications
- open source


Environment :

- Install node
https://nodejs.org/en

node -v
v20.10.0

- Install npm 

npm install -g npm

npm update

$ npm -version
9.5.1

- angular cli

npm install -g @angular/cli

npm install -g @angular/cli@latest

ng version

Angular CLI: 17.1.1       
Node: 20.10.0
Package Manager: npm 9.5.1


Key Features :

- Component based  : Modular,Smaller reusable and encapsulated component

@component 
public class classname
{

}
- has its own simpler,has its own logic,HTML template,css styling

- Two way data binding 

binding data from source(model) to view and view to source(model)

- Dependency Injection 

services can be injected into the existing component / entire application


- Routing

navigating across multiple location in the application

route[] :{
    {home},
    {contact}
    {property}
}

- Forms 

encapsulates multiple form controls.

- Perform form validation and form data binding

<form>
<label>
<input>
<select>
</form>

Two types of forms :

1.Template driven - [(ngModel)] - Do the validation on forms(HTML Template)
2.Reactive form - ngForm , formgroup,formcontrol - do the server side validation(class)


- HTTP Client

- built in class that will allows server side request.

- Directives :

- Extend the functionality of HTML & class
- 3 types

1.Structural directives - ngIf,ngFor,ngSwitch
2.Attribute directives - ngClass,ngStyle
3.Component directive - @Component 


- Testing support : built in unit test and end-end testing tool like Jasmine and Karma 

Why Choose angular compared to react ?

- Angular uses two way data binding - real DOM
- Whereas react uses one way data binding - virtual DOM

Understanding the folder structure in Angular :

.vscode -> launch -> url
src -> app -> app.comp.html,css,ts,router,modules
angular.json -> outputpath(that can be referenced by other applications)
package.json -> basic cmd info along with package details
tsconfig -> typescript configurations

Components :

- Main building block of your angular application
- It contains class- data logic,properties,methods,di,consructor + html + css + test
- @component

ng generate component <componentname>

ng g c <componentname>

@Input & @Output => pass the data between parent and child comonents

Data Binding : pass data 

1.One way data binding 

model ---> view

2.two way data binding

model ---> view && view ---> model

-include forms module package

[(ngModel)]


* Property Binding
* Attribute Binding
* Class Binding
* Style Binding
* Event Binding 



Property Binding : Allows us to bind the value to the HTML Element

[binding-target]="binding- source"

Attribute Binding : Binding to the attributes of the html elemnt.
